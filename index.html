            <p>I'm a senior at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science. My programming background spans Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C/C++. I have experience in manufacturing and am passionate about process optimization, efficiency, and automation. I enjoy working in web development, embedded systems, or generally anything that requires problem solving. I have a diverse technical background that also includes welding, manual and CNC machining, residential and industrial electrical, CAD, and basic electronics‚Äîamong other things.
                <br><br>
                I spend my free time running, hiking, weightlifting, sailing, and skiing, and have a particular interest in additive manufacturing and metrology. Having recently lived in Europe for over 2 years, I've gained a broader perspective on culture and collaboration.

            <p>I'm currently a Junior at UNC Charlotte, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development. My programming knowledge extends to Python, C/C++, and Java mainly, though I am currently learning JavaScript. I'm heavily team inclined due to a long history with playing basketball(high school/collegiate) and thoroughy enjoy being able to connect to differing personalities.
                <br><br>
                My time is spent listening to music, playing basketball, weightlifting, learning how to play an instrument for a few days, and playing video games during times of immense boredom.
